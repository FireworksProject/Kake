Kake
====

Get your Kake and eat it too; Build your project from Firefox.
--------------------------------------------------------------

> *This project is a work in progress and has not been released yet.*

### About Kake.
* A new kind of build tool with an intuitive *graphical* interface.
* Installs into Firefox as a browser addon just like Firebug.
* Allows you to write your build scripts with JS!

### What is Kake good for?
Kake can do anything that any other build tool can do because of the
extraordinary system capabilities available to Firefox addons. Here are a few
good ideas:

* Write [LESS CSS](http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js); build it instead!
* Compile your JS files all into one compressed file for super fast page loads.
* Build a JS module library. (More on this later.)
* Build, test, and deploy your website with one click.
* You can even build your compiled projects like [Node.js](http://github.com/ry/node)

#### *Kake is a work in progress, so stay tuned.*
